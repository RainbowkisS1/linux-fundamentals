# Getting Started with Linux Basics

## What is Linux?
 Linux is a free and open-source operating system kernel, first released by Finnish computer scientist Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991. Unlike proprietary systems like Windows or macOS, Linux is built on open-source principles, meaning its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute under licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL).  This fosters global collaboration, innovation, and transparency.

## Why Linux matters in cybersecurity
### 1. Linux is open source
- Unlike windows, the source code of linux is available to view, edit and use according to our needs. If you are trying to make a system work in a way it was not intended to, being able to mend its source code is necessary.

### 2. Linux is transperant
- To hack effectively, attackers must know and understand the system they are working on. linux is transperant which means it allows to view and edit each one of its working parts according to our needs.
- other operating systems like windows or MAC OS make it as hard as possible to let us view internal working of its system, making it not suitable  for security and offensive intents. 

### 3. Most offensive/defensive tools are written for linux

## Common misconceptions

### 1. “Linux is only for hackers or advanced users”

Reality: Linux has become very user-friendly. Distributions like Ubuntu, Mint, or Pop!_OS are designed for beginners and daily use. You don’t need to know commands to use it effectively, although learning the terminal is helpful.

### 2. “Linux is not compatible with software I use”

Reality: While Windows software doesn’t always run natively, there are often Linux alternatives (GIMP for Photoshop, LibreOffice for MS Office, Blender, etc.) or ways to run Windows programs using Wine or virtual machines.

### 3. “The terminal is required for everything”

Reality: The terminal is powerful, but for most tasks (browsing, office work, media), the GUI is enough. Only for development, system troubleshooting, or automation will you need the command line often.

### 4. “Linux is virus-free”

Reality: Linux is less targeted by malware, but it’s not completely immune. Good security practices still matter (keeping software updated, managing permissions, avoiding shady repos).

### 5. “Linux is slow or not suitable for gaming”

Reality: Linux can run on very old hardware efficiently, and gaming on Linux has improved a lot thanks to Steam Proton. Not all games run natively, but a huge number do now.

### 6. “Learning Linux will break my computer”

Reality: Most beginners think a wrong command will brick their system. While sudo rm -rf / would be catastrophic, most mistakes are recoverable, especially if you use virtual machines or dual boot.

### 7. “Linux doesn’t have drivers”

Reality: Modern distributions have excellent hardware support, and most drivers are included. Rarely, you might need proprietary drivers (like for some Nvidia GPUs), but installing them is straightforward.

### 8. “Linux is free, so it’s low quality”

Reality: Linux itself is free and open-source, but it’s highly polished. Companies like Red Hat, Canonical, and SUSE invest heavily in enterprise-grade Linux systems.

### 9. “All Linux distributions are the same”

Reality: Distros differ in package management, default software, and use case. Ubuntu is beginner-friendly, Arch is for learning deeply, Fedora is cutting-edge, and Debian is very stable.

### 10. “I must know programming to use Linux”

Reality: Not true. You can use Linux like Windows or Mac for browsing, media, and office work. Programming knowledge helps, but it’s not mandatory.

## How to install linux
- for reference, i will be using kali linux here in a virtual machine
- A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based computer that emulates a physical machine, running its own operating system and applications using virtualized hardware resources.  It operates as an isolated environment on a host computer, borrowing CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity from the physical machine while appearing to be a standalone computer to the user.
- You can install any **virtual machine** (like virtualbox, VMware etc.) from any browser.
-  The next step is to download an **ISO file** of your required distro.(ours is kali linux here)
-  once finished downloading the ISO file, open your virtual machiner and select **create new**.
-  then upload the ISO file where asked.
-  then finish setting up your linux VM.
