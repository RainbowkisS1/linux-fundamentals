# linux-fundamentals (security-oriented)
This repository contains my **conceptual understanding of linux** from a **Cybersecurity perspective**  (using kali linux as base)
The focus is on:
- how linux works internally
- why these concepts matter in security
- how attackers and defenders interact with the system

## Why this repository? 
 - To build a deep understanding of linux internals and system behavior
 - To connect linux concepts directly with cybersecurity use cases
 - To focus on **why** things work, not just how to *run commands*

## How to use this repository
  Each topic is explained using :
   - Conceptual explanations
   - diagrams (where required)
   - real world security context
  This repository intentionally avoids lab walkthroughs.
  labs like TRYHACKME & HACKTHEBOX are practiced on separate repositories.

 ## TOPICS COVERED:
### Core linux:
1. Getting started with basics
2. Linux architecture
3. File system hierarchy and permissions
4. process management
5. Enviroment variables

### System and administration:
6. Software management
7. Logging system
8. Services (usage and abuse)
9. compressing and archiving
10. Automating tasks(with python)

### Networking and Security:
 11. Text manipulation
 12. Network analysis & management
 13. wireless network inspection
 14. security and anonymity concepts

### Advanced:
 15. linux kernel and loadable modules
 16. Bash scripting

 ## Security point of view:
   Through this, I aim to provide an security oriented review of linux and how can that feature be miused and why attackers care about that feature.

  ## Who this is for?
  - For students new in this field.
  - Beginners who want to enter in this field but are unaware how to.
  - Those who want conceptual understanding instead of command memorisation.

  ## NOTE:
   This repository is a part of my larger learning path in cybersecurity:
   -Linux fundamentals (this repo)
   -Netwroking basics.
   -cybersecurity basics.
   -Popular types of security attacks.
   -web security(fundamentals).
   -cloud security(fundamentals).
   -Linux labs
   -TRYHACKME labs
   -HACKTHEBOX labs
   -PORTSWIGGER labs
   -languages(python & C)
   -python labs
   
   This is my learning journey with my own understanding of topics mentioned above.
   content will be updated as soon as i learn it.
   for educational purposes.
